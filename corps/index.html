<p>Super Maniacs Coordinator Corps is not only a team, itâ€™s a family of
legends and crackerjacks. The Coordinators are the most precious part
of this pop culture community. They are the Harbingers of all the other
outcasts, they are the Paragons of courage, destiny and love. With 200+
Official Coordinators, we founded 5 extraordinary Corps with 5
fabulous Overseers from the Executive Committee. The efforts of the
Coordinators to seek the present is not only mentionable, it is to be
written in the pages of history of Super Maniacs. The toil they do
relentlessly to make their own squad the best not only amplifies us to
reach our goals but also enhances our functions to render service and
entertainment to others as much as possible.</p>
